# Notes Management API

## Overview

This is a **RESTful API** built using **Node.js** and **Express.js** to manage notes. The API provides the following functionality:

- Retrieve all notes.
- Add a new note with a title and content.
- Update an existing note by ID.
- Delete a note by ID.

The API ensures basic validation such as non-empty titles and a minimum of 10 characters for content. It also handles errors gracefully to improve the user experience.
