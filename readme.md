# Cracent Task Repository

## Overview

This repository contains solutions to 3 tasks, each organized into separate folders. Each task is designed to address different challenges, including building a **To-Do List Application**, a **User Management System**, and a **RESTful API for Notes Management**. Each folder contains all the necessary code and assets to implement and run the solution for that specific task.

## Folder Structure

- **`Task1_ToDoApplication`**: A To-Do List Application with features like adding tasks, marking them as completed, deleting tasks, filtering tasks, and persisting data using **LocalStorage**.
  
- **`Task2_NotesAPI`**: A RESTful API built with **Node.js** and **Express.js** to manage notes, providing endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting notes with basic validation.


- **`Task3_UserMangementSystem`**: A User Management System with a front-end form to add, retrieve, and delete users data stored persistently using **LocalStorage**.
